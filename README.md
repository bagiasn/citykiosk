# code4fun

This project consists of three parts:
1. Android app - for scheduling visits, getting notifications for possible rearrangements, viewing your history of visits.
2. ESP8266 (with ArduinoIDE) - for automatically checking-in the user and helping the system getting a sense of a live queue.
3  NodeJS - for managing the whole backend functionality, including database management etc.

Code from 2 and 3 coming soon.
